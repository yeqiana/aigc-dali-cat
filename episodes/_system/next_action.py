"""Derive the single next Story OS runtime action without creating a second state machine.

The only Episode stage authority remains meta/episode-state.json. This file is a
runtime convenience for Work/ChatGPT host loops so they do not need to rescan the
repository after every model/image action.

Every field here is a projection of files already on disk: meta/episode-state.json,
meta/runtime-runner-state.json and meta/runtime/reviews/. In particular host_loop
and orphaned_pending_work report whether a host loop is running -- they never
start, restart, stop, signal or wait on a runner. There is no watchdog here.
