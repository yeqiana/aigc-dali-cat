"""The official detached resident Driver: `story_os.py driver start <episode>`.

A scoped step is a Codex conversation that takes tens of minutes (CREATIVE_STORY
~16 min, PREIMAGE_COMPILE ~69 min measured on 2026-09-15). The host tool that
launches Story OS gives each call 300 seconds, so a Driver started in the
foreground is killed long before the step it is running. That is not a Story OS
timeout and it is not a Codex failure -- it is the launcher's budget, and the
only fix is for the Driver to stop being a child of the launcher.

`.storyos_cache/dag_detach.py` proved the mechanism but is an operator's private
script: it is not on any Story OS entrypoint, it keeps one global pid file for
the whole repository, and it starts `runtime_dag.py` directly -- bypassing the
resident Driver that P0-B makes the single production owner. This module is the
same mechanism as a product capability, launching the one resident Driver.

What it does NOT do, deliberately:

  * It never kills anything. Not the Driver, not Codex, and never
    `taskkill /IM codex.exe` -- which would take out the user's Codex desktop
    backend along with the orphan. Recovery is "start the Driver again"; the
    orphaned task's result is claimed by in_flight_codex_task, not destroyed.
  * It does not spawn the DAG as a grandchild. The detached process *is* the
    Driver: it holds the runner owner lock, writes the heartbeat and executes
    `runtime_dag.execute` in-process, so the recorded pid is the process that
    actually does the work and the log file is that process's own stdout.
